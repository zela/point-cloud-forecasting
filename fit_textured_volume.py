# # Fit a volume via raymarching
# 
# This tutorial shows how to fit a volume given a set of views of a scene using differentiable volumetric rendering.
# 
# More specifically, this tutorial will explain how to:
# 1. Create a differentiable volumetric renderer.
# 2. Create a Volumetric model (including how to use the `Volumes` class).
# 3. Fit the volume based on the images using the differentiable volumetric renderer. 
# 4. Visualize the predicted volume.

# ## 1. Generate images of the scene and masks
# 
# The following cell generates our training data.
# It renders the cow mesh from the `fit_textured_mesh.ipynb` tutorial from several viewpoints and returns:
# 1. A batch of image and silhouette tensors that are produced by the cow mesh renderer.
# 2. A set of cameras corresponding to each render.
# 
# Note: For the purpose of this tutorial, which aims at explaining the details of volumetric rendering, we do not explain how the mesh rendering, implemented in the `generate_cow_renders` function, works. Please refer to `fit_textured_mesh.ipynb` for a detailed explanation of mesh rendering.

# ## 2. Initialize the volumetric renderer
# 
# The following initializes a volumetric renderer that emits a ray from each pixel of a target image and samples a set of uniformly-spaced points along the ray. At each ray-point, the corresponding density and color value is obtained by querying the corresponding location in the volumetric model of the scene (the model is described & instantiated in a later cell).
# 
# The renderer is composed of a *raymarcher* and a *raysampler*.
# - The *raysampler* is responsible for emitting rays from image pixels and sampling the points along them. Here, we use the `NDCMultinomialRaysampler` which follows the standard PyTorch3D coordinate grid convention (+X from right to left; +Y from bottom to top; +Z away from the user).
# - The *raymarcher* takes the densities and colors sampled along each ray and renders each ray into a color and an opacity value of the ray's source pixel. Here we use the `EmissionAbsorptionRaymarcher` which implements the standard Emission-Absorption raymarching algorithm.

# In[ ]:


# render_size describes the size of both sides of the 
# rendered images in pixels. We set this to the same size
# as the target images. I.e. we render at the same
# size as the ground truth images.
render_size = target_images.shape[1]

# Our rendered scene is centered around (0,0,0) 
# and is enclosed inside a bounding box
# whose side is roughly equal to 3.0 (world units).
volume_extent_world = 3.0

# 1) Instantiate the raysampler.
# Here, NDCMultinomialRaysampler generates a rectangular image
# grid of rays whose coordinates follow the PyTorch3D
# coordinate conventions.
# Since we use a volume of size 128^3, we sample n_pts_per_ray=150,
# which roughly corresponds to a one ray-point per voxel.
# We further set the min_depth=0.1 since there is no surface within
# 0.1 units of any camera plane.
raysampler = NDCMultinomialRaysampler(
    image_width=render_size,
    image_height=render_size,
    n_pts_per_ray=150,
    min_depth=0.1,
    max_depth=volume_extent_world,
)


# 2) Instantiate the raymarcher.
# Here, we use the standard EmissionAbsorptionRaymarcher 
# which marches along each ray in order to render
# each ray into a single 3D color vector 
# and an opacity scalar.
raymarcher = EmissionAbsorptionRaymarcher()

# Finally, instantiate the volumetric render
# with the raysampler and raymarcher objects.
renderer = VolumeRenderer(
    raysampler=raysampler, raymarcher=raymarcher,
)


# ## 3. Initialize the volumetric model
# 
# Next we instantiate a volumetric model of the scene. This quantizes the 3D space to cubical voxels, where each voxel is described with a 3D vector representing the voxel's RGB color and a density scalar which describes the opacity of the voxel (ranging between [0-1], the higher the more opaque).
# 
# In order to ensure the range of densities and colors is between [0-1], we represent both volume colors and densities in the logarithmic space. During the forward function of the model, the log-space values are passed through the sigmoid function to bring the log-space values to the correct range.
# 
# Additionally, `VolumeModel` contains the renderer object. This object stays unaltered throughout the optimization.
# 
# In this cell we also define the `huber` loss function which computes the discrepancy between the rendered colors and masks.

# ## 4. Fit the volume
#

# 
# In order to fit the volume, we render it from the viewpoints of the `target_cameras`

# The comparison is done by evaluating the mean huber (smooth-l1) error between corresponding
# pairs of `target_images`/`rendered_images` and `target_silhouettes`/`rendered_silhouettes`.

# ## 6. Conclusion
# 
# In this tutorial, we have shown how to optimize a 3D volumetric representation of a scene such that the renders of the volume from known viewpoints match the observed images for each viewpoint. The rendering was carried out using the PyTorch3D's volumetric renderer composed of an `NDCMultinomialRaysampler` and an `EmissionAbsorptionRaymarcher`.
